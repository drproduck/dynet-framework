# A Dynet Framework (Python)

A Dynet Framework written by Johnny Wei (jwei@umass.edu). The goal is to make it easy to experiment with new models. The code should provide basic handling of input/output, training, testing, and validation. A few baselines for language and sequence to sequence modelling are provided. Don't be afraid to look into the source - take a look at the baselines as examples! If it's not obvious on how to extend this for your needs, let me know through github or email. 

The framework is still largely a work in progress. The README is one of many things that need to be done.
